  "intro_text": "Hello little explorers! Today, we're going to have fun with a new sound. Can anyone guess which one? It's the sound 'd' \u2013 super cool, isn't it? \n\nNow let's pretend to be a little doggie. Yes, you heard me right! Do you know the noise a doggie makes when he finds his favorite toy? He says 'd-d-dig', 'd-d-dig' in his doggie language. Try saying it with me \u2013 'd-d-d'. Good job! \n\nYou see, when you make the 'd' sound, your tongue touches the top of your mouth, right behind your top front teeth. Say 'd-d-d-d'. Awesome! \n\nSo remember, every time you see this letter 'D', imagine a doggie digging for his toy, and it will help you say the sound 'd'!\n\nKeep practicing, buddies! I\u2019m so proud of all of you.",
  "follow_up_question": "Alright, team, pop quiz time! Are you ready? Now, think of the noise our pretend doggie makes while it's digging. Here's your question: Can you tell me a word that starts with the same 'd-d-d' sound? Is it 'cat' or is it 'duck'? Remember, 'd-d-d'. Now, can anyone shout out the answer?",
